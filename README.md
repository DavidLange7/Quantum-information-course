This is the full collection of assignments done for a Quantum Computation course focused on introducing Tensor Network methods done at Padova University, held by Professor Simone Montangero.
The assignments start from basic Fortran coding and proceed with solving Time-dependent and Time-independent Schr√∂dinger equations, as well as studying the Ising model.
The final assigment is an implementation of the Real space renormalization group (RSRG).
Finally, a final project was proposed that took approximately 1 1/2 months to finish, implementing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm applied to a Matrix product state and tested on the Ising chain with open boundaries.
