This code implements the Assigment 1 of Quantum information course Autumn 2023

The following files are included:

#exercise 3 (multiplying 2 matrices with explicit/intrinsic methods)
matrix.f90 #fortran code
matrix_auto.sh #to run the f90 file using predefined range of square matrix dimensions 
		and outputing the computation times of the three methods in the one/two/three.txt files
matrix_man.sh #if you want to run the f90 file but put two matrices manually to be multiplied
matrix_auto_plot.py #to plot the one/two/three.txt files
one.txt, two.txt, three.txt #the three files that are automatically (first deleted if existing) generated in the matrix_auto.sh that store the
			     computation times of the three methods of matrix multiplication for later analysis 

Note: -For the .py to run you have to change the np.loadtxt(PATH). Also, in order to run the matrix.f90 program the files
	'one.txt', 'two.txt' and 'three.txt' files have to exist in order to run.
      -The "dimension" (of the square matrices) array is generated manually in the .py file, so should be checked to actually match with the inputted 
       dimensions in the matrix_auto.sh run to have meaningful plots 

#####Some explanation for matrix.f90#####
	-uses first a do do do loop to compute the multiplication of two matrices (either given automatically or manually from console input)
	-uses the intrinsic matmul function of fortran
		-for both the different computation times can be printed onto txt files which then can be used to plot number of dimensions vs. comp time

In &matrix.f90: (only these variables are changeable, the rest is fixed by algorithm)
	-bin_glob is either 0 or 1, 0 creates automatically the matrix entries while 1 means manually typing them into terminal
	-n_mat1, m_mat1 are number of rows, number of columns of first matrix
	-n_mat2, m_mat2 are number of rows, number of columns of second matrix
lines 1-32: module debugger that incorporates printing subroutines for different types (integer, real, imaginary) to be used
	    to print variables at needed locations in the code 
lines 34-180: Program that executes the exercise
	lines 44-57: user input to initialize matrices
	lines 63-96: creating the matrices either manually or automatically
	lines 105-132: explicit rowwise matrix multiplication
	lines 136-161: explicit columnwise matrix multiplication
	lines 164-179: intrinsic fortran function "matmul" matrix multiplication
########
A terminal run of matrix.f90 using gfortran:

gfortran matrix.f90 -o mat
./mat
bin_glob #either 0 or 1
n_mat1
m_mat1
n_mat2 #remember m_mat1 and n_mat2 should be the same for matrix multiplication
m_mat2
########
However, to run matrix.f90 it is most convenient to use the two bash scripts
