This code implements Exercises 3 of Assignment 2 of Quantum information course Autumn 2023

the following files are included:
#the fortran code for exercise 3 
cmatrix_mod.f90
 (complex matrix derived type+new subroutines, and a program that executes a test run)

#a .txt file that cmatrix_mod.f90 uses to store results
cmatrix_mod_output.txt

#####Some explanation for debug.f90#######
    -can be used to print either real/imaginary/integer values at wanted locations
In &debug.f90:
    -var is the variable that has to be specified to be printed
    -debug is the level of debugging wanted (0 for no debugging, otherwise 1 or 2)

#####Some explanation for cmatrix_mod.f90#######
    -implements a new derived type "cmatrix" (a double complex matrix)
    -includes subroutines that can calculate trace/adjoint

In &cmatrix_mod.f90:
    -bin_glob is variable which can be 0,1,2
        -0 matrix has all entries the same (1 currently)
        -1 matrix can be inputted manually in terminal
        -2 random_number is used to generate random matrix

lines 1-204: the cmatrix module
    lines 4-8: type matrix
    lines 24-111: subroutine matrix initialization
    lines 113-136: subroutine matrix trace calculation
    lines 138-167: subroutine matrix adjoin calculation
    lines 169-203: subroutine writing of all results in the txt file
lines 206-219: program that tests the module
############
A terminal run of cmatrix_mod.f90 using gfortran:
gfortran cmatrix_mod.f90 .o cmat
./cmat
n #number of rows of matrix (integer)
m #number of columns of matrix (integer)
tmp #specifies if real (enter 0) or complex (enter 1) matrix will be used
############
Note: Currently, if a real matrix is to be used, the code simply converts it to a complex matrix with all
      elements imaginary parts equal to 0.
